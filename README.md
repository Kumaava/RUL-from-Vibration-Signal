## RUL-from-Vibration-Signal

#### Problem: To predict the remaining life of a bearing in industrial assets such as pumps, compressors, gearbox etc. Please have a look at the supporting document.
Refere to the research paper : ANN Pump Life Prediction.pdf
For data contact  : avaneesh.paper@gmail.com


#### Deliverable:
•    A graph showing RMS & Kurtosis
•    Weibull Hazard Rate & Parameter Estimates (shape & scale parameter)


#### Results of training & validation set

•    Output performance of test set

•    Training & Validation error of the proposed model (as shown in the reference research paper)

•    An idea for multi sensor fusion to actually predict the remaining useful of the rotating equipment as a whole
